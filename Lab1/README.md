## PART II
Multiplexer 2-to-1 4 bit



## PART III
Multiplexer 4-to-1 2 bit


## PART IV
7 segments decoder to print the letters "H", "E", "L" and "O"

## PART V
Multiplexer 3-to-1 3 bits to print an static "HELLO" in five 7-segments

## PART VI
Multiplexer 3-to-1 3 bits to print an static "HELLO" in six 7-segments, creating a space at the end/begining to create the ilusion of moving

## (extra) PART VII 
Implement a counter to trigger de segments without using the selector and make de word "HELLO" move by it self. Can be adjusted in time to go faster and slower.
